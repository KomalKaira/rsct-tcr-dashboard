TS1: How have you been?
CS1: Good day. I've been good, Just getting more into the studying bit and slowly finding my rhythm. So I think I was struggling a bit last week because I suddenly had to get into the rhythm of studying, and it’s a lot of heavy stuff. But I’m like okay, I can’t do everything at once…
This is not an easy exam. So it’s okay, I haven’t been applying for months. If I don’t apply for the next two to three weeks, nothing’s going to happen. But I really need to bloody finish this exam. That’s my main focus. My attention’s a bit scattered, but I keep looking at my phone or wanting to play a game. Now I’m learning to understand that when my body is tired, it’s tired. Looking at screens doesn’t help. Although I woke up with a bit of a headache because I haven’t been drinking enough water…But when I sat down to focus for 15 minutes before our call, I was able to focus. I said maybe I need to keep a clock instead of my phone.
CS2: I’m trying not to feel guilty about not being available to other people. Not guilty exactly but I feel like chit-chatting, and then I’m not able to cut the call and say, “Yo, I need to study.” I don’t think people at this age understand. Like, how the hell do you study? I don’t know, but it’s a bit of a motivator for me to push my brain and keep it active. Yesterday, after a long time, I sat down in the evening even though I was tired and I said, “Okay, let’s write notes.”
CS3: And I remembered that early-20s “me”. I’m like, “Man, you used to do this. You just need to balance it out. Focus on one thing at a time.”
But yeah, mostly it’s been good. I wanted to give the exam, but that day I went into my study room and saw a lizard on the floor and I was like, “Yo, bye.”
TS2: Oh noo…!!.
CS4: I had gone to take my textbook, then I opened the door again to take my bottles. Then I shut the room and realized, “Shit, there’s no Hit.”
And for some reason, I took the jhadu and Lizol—not like that was going to help me. It ran away and I was like, “Great.”
TS3: You  threw lizol over it?
CS5: No, dude, I wish I had. But then I ordered Hit and sprayed the room.
The funny thing is, in the morning when I slept in, I usually sleep in mom’s room when she’s not there, I went into my bathroom to pee and was like, “What is that?”
I’m hoping it was the same one, because I was like, “Yo, I can’t deal with two.”
TS4: It’s time for revenge.
CS6: It went in the drain, thanks to Viji.
And then I was too scared to study in that room today. I finally went in and I was like, “F*** it, it’s my house. That guy (lizard) can leave.” It’s funny, but I don’t know why I associate the lizard with (ex boyfriend)—a sneaky little thing—and I keep throwing it out. I always have, thought it’s good luck. But now I’m like, maybe I’m just killing my good luck. Still, I can’t have you (lizard) in my house. So, that’s that. I was a bit scared, but otherwise, it’s been good. I can feel myself prioritizing myself every day, and I like it. Sometimes it dips, but I’m like, it’s fine.
Like sometimes it goes a bit up and… down, with my distractions or talking on the phone.
I try not to be too harsh on myself, but at the same time I’m like—you have to prioritize yourself.
You’re trying. You still have this thing where you want to be there for other people, but it drains my energy sometimes. And then I have no energy left for me.
CS7: But now I’m learning to ask myself: do I really want to talk, or am I doing this out of habit?
That’s been a very big question in the last 2–3 days. Like the other day, I didn’t answer someone’s call, and I didn’t even feel bad. Earlier I would have replied, “Hey, sorry I didn’t answer.”
Now I’m just like, “If I didn’t want to talk, I didn’t want to talk.”
CS8: It felt like such a big shift. Like, damn, that’s powerful. I didn’t answer, and I didn’t explain myself. And it didn’t feel like I was being rude, it just felt like I was honouring my space. I think I’m going to cry just thinking about it. I haven’t done that in years.
TS5: What’s happening inside you as you say that?
CS9: I don’t know. It’s like, I think I feel proud. That I didn’t need to justify it. That I wasn’t apologetic. I always feel like I have to compensate for taking space. Like, “Hey, sorry, just give me a day.”But this time I didn’t. I just chose me. And the world didn’t fall apart.
TS6: That line, "and the world didn’t fall apart." It seems to capture so much!
CS10: Yeah. It’s new, but it’s real. I feel like I’m reintroducing myself to who I’ve always been, just with more clarity now. Not fighting so much. Not proving so much.  There’s still fear sometimes, like, will people think I’m selfish or too distant? But I’m slowly starting to care less. Not in a numb way, just... in a grounded way.Like, I’m not abandoning them. I’m just not abandoning myself anymore.
TS7: That’s a really powerful shift.
CS11: It feels big. But I don’t want to make it bigger than it is either, you know?
I just want to keep practising it until it becomes natural. Like yesterday, I was really tired by 9, but N (friend) messaged, “Wanna catch up?” And usually I would say yes and drag the call till 1. But I didnt reply or say, “I’m winding down for the day. Let’s talk another time.” And I didnt pick up and just  put the phone away. I actually slept early. My body thanked me for it this morning. It’s so basic, but it felt like I was finally choosing myself in small ways. It is basic but it made me feel good to choose myself. 
TS8: That’s not basic at all. It’s a boundary. One you upheld without falling prey to guilt.
CS12: Yeah… it felt good. No resentment, no overthinking. Just, “This is what I need right now.” I want more of that. I think I used to confuse boundaries with rejection. Like if I say no, someone will feel hurt or think I’m cold. But now I’m learning, it’s not rejection. It’s regulation. For me.
TS9: That shift from rejection to regulation, that’s huge.
CS13: Yeah, it’s changing how I talk to myself too. I’m not as mean in my head these days. I catch it when I am.
TS10: What would you say helped you soften?
CS14: I think… this space. Being in therapy. Saying things out loud that I’ve never said. Also being seen and not being rushed. Like, I can say something messy, and you don’t fix it. You just hear me. I think it is that. : Like I’ve always had this loud voice in my head, like I have to do it all, be it all, and now I feel like I’m finally telling that voice, you’ve done enough, let me breathe. Not everything has to be earned. I just want to exist on some days.
TS11: Yeah, that voice trying to hold you back is such an old voice.
CS15: Yeah, like even yesterday I was telling mom, “I studied today,” and then I caught myself, like why am I reporting this? Why do I feel the need to prove that I’m doing okay? She didn’t even ask. It’s like I’ve internalised this audience, like someone is watching and scoring my day, and unless I perform well, I feel off. I want to unlearn that. Not just logically, but in my body. I want to feel at ease without earning it. 
TS12: That has been a very old way of saying, “I’m still worthy of being here.”
CS16: Yeah, it is. And I don’t even know when it started. Maybe college, maybe earlier. But I want to feel quiet in my body again. Just like… drink tea without thinking I should be reading. Sit on the swing without narrating it in my head as a “wellness moment.” Just be.I think that’s why mornings are so hard. It’s like I wake up and immediately I’m like, “Okay, how do I earn today?”
TS13: Right from the start of the day?
CS17: Yeah, Like even something as basic as brushing my teeth or making my bed feels like, “Oh, I’m being productive, I can count that.” That’s how my brain has started to talk—like it’s measuring every step. : Like my body’s doing something and my mind is already writing the report card for it. And I want to stop doing that. I want to feel my own day without measuring it.
TS14: That must be exhausting, to constantly monitor yourself, even in tiny movements.
CS18: Exactly. And when I don’t perform, or don’t do enough, it feels like I failed. But failed who? No one’s watching. But it still feels like I let someone down. Like I disappointed this invisible metric I didn’t even agree to. 
TS15: I notice that it feels like you're tight in your body. Your shoulders seem tense and uneasy.
CS19: It is true. My back is tight because of the way I’m sitting when I’m studying. I love that you can also feel my body, not just my feelings. But before anything i want to read my linkedin post to you. Now when I read my own writing, I feel like I’m very articulate, but I also make people feel things through my writing. And I feel like most people don’t do that. I say things that people think but don’t say. I can make people feel. Even V (close househelp) said that. I tried to explain what I do to even my mom, and my mom was like, “You’re giving your free ideas away as usual.” And I was like, “I’m not giving them away. I’m building my repository.”
CS20: I was thinking, okay, later once I have a bit of breathing room, because I do like to write, I want to write longer-form pieces. I have to explain things rather than this generic ChatGPT way of writing. I’m like, do I use ChatGPT to just put together my points? Maybe. But the point is, I want to use my voice. Slowly I’ve been seeing random people now commenting on my posts. So it’s good. I’m happy. I’m just trying to talk about things I’ve wanted to talk about, but to show my own expertise in a way that’s not like “just write because I have to write.” It’s been good. It’s almost two and a half months of writing for the most part. N (Friend) also tells me that i write well. I feel like when I talk to N(friend), she’s one person who has started to say things in a validating way. And I feel good. And I don’t know if she does it because she feels I need it, or maybe she realizes that, I don’t know that she hasn't shown up for me before. But I’m learning to accept it and I’m learning to receive.  I feel like I don’t need to keep explaining it but  it’s like those heavy feelings come up sometimes. Like fear. I still sometimes feel, what will this one think, what will that one think? But I’m like, “No, it’s okay. You have just been around a bad room of people.” I get it now , like even mentally, I know saying no is okay, or that I’m allowed to prioritise rest. But when I actually do it, my body goes into this alert mode, like something bad is going to happen. Like I’m bracing for a fight or for someone to be upset with me. 
TC16: I am noticing that we’re in a very interesting space with N. She comes up so often in our conversations. I think both of you have begun to share somewhat of a mutual relationship, and she’s someone who has started to witness you in ways you maybe haven’t always experienced in friendships. So like you previously stated in the session that feeling of being  uncomfortable telling her you are busy, it seems like when you do have to draw that boundary, there’s a part of you that finds it very uncomfortable. So you choose not to pick the call and to actively say, “I want to study,” or “Right now’s not the time.” As you were sharing that at the start of the session, I was thinking back on what may be happening. You have reflected on all painful previous experiences, maybe in past jobs or relationships, where people let you down. So it seems that when you have to pause with N and draw a boundary, that old fear that you’ll be left if you choose yourself becomes more heightened.
CS21: umm, you’re right in a sense. Some parts of it feel really good because I am moving towards standing up for myself when i draw a boundary and being more empowered. But it’s also such a real threat to everything I’ve believed until now. I also want to acknowledge  It's not like I'm unique in this situation. You know what I mean? To say that dude, it's normal. It's not linear. It never was. But sometimes you feel like, how we’ve discussed before, the stupid people think they’re really intelligent, and the intelligent people always doubt themselves. And I’m like, “Why is this happening to me, people copy what I say or do, but never want to publicly give me the recognition?” I feel like there’s something about me where people think it’s okay to put me down. But with others, they hype them up. And it hurts, because I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. So yeah, these were  the two or three things that came up this week. And I can’t believe I actually said all of this to you.
TS17: Just to pause here,  I wonder if this thing about “people putting you down” is happening right now or is that a rebounding feeling from our past?
CS22: No, no, It is in the past, nothing right now. I'm just saying people have done this before. Like at my last job when people only realised later how i upheld community or how my friends made fun of me earlier but now copy me and tell me i was right. 
TS18: So these feelings are rebounding not being informed by the present yet it is coming up when we are reflecting on your relationship with N. 
CS23: I know it is in the past.  Sometimes when i hear other people talk or they seek my help,  my mind would be like, "Yeah, but you were alone when you were struggling." And I have to remind myself  "Don't do that. Don't go there. How is that helping?” It is like I understand logically and mentally but not sure about how emotionally accepted it is inside me. 
TS19: The brain keeps looping back to that like  it's a very relevant piece of information for you - “I did this alone I did this alone” - almost like its so significant, what do you think makes it significant?  What maybe causing this to keep rebounding?
CS24:  I don't know. Maybe I feel now ,when you ask me that question, that at that time I was just trying to survive. I don't even know if I got to feel whatever feelings I wanted to feel at that time.  Because I didn't have a choice where I could go and talk to somebody or explain that I wish someone held my hand. I wish someone told me that these are the things that you should do. Yes, my mom was there and yes my friends were there but a lot of it has been my inner strength.  Sometimes I guess part of learning that lesson is going through it alone but It really sucks because now I'm sitting on the other side and…to go through that alone was difficult and I think the other thing that comes to mind right now is that nobody knew I was suffering. Sometimes you just want someone to recognize your pain and say, not be like, " my god, I know you'll handle it with so much grace."d I think the other thing is like now that people are going through painful things in their life, it's like suddenly my pain has a story and validation like it didnt before. But i dont know, I have been asking this for years.
TS20: It sounds like you do have an understanding of what might be keeping these older feelings alive.
CS25: Of course I do.But I think I'm at a place where,  like I said, my friends are also becoming a lot more open. I don't know if it is me making space for them to be a part of my life because in the past it was only me making space for other people. and I also realize that maybe this is all my friends can give me. and I'm open to making new friends and some of my friends are evolving and growing. So that's also important. But I don't know what to do with those painful moments. Do I give it space or do I just allow it time?
TS 21:  From where i see it, it is possible that every time you help somebody, it's a reminder of how there is nobody to help you or even witness it for you. So, you're holding dual feelings. The feeling of giving something that was never offered to you, and so much joy in being able to help someone else in that moment but also silent grief continuously having to do this continuously having to pour much more from your own self.So irrespective of how much your current relationships may have evolved maybe a part of you still wants and desires a little bit more?
CS26:I think a lot about companionship now and I am asking myself if I am finally ready? But it's like  something that I keep wanting to discuss with you. Maybe we will look at it next week..I can feel it coming and I've been telling you this for a while, and it's not just the physical part that to discuss, but it's more like how do I really trust and allow someone into my space?  I don't have the words to verbalize it fully and I feel like now that sufficient time has passed between A(ex boyfriend) and me.  I just realized how damaging that relationship was for my self-esteem and for my ego and everything because I realized how insecure that guy was.  I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but when someone really makes you change so much, I mean, when you want to, I can't say he made me change, but his behaviour- that's a reflection of of him. 
TS22: There's a lot that you brought up today. I think there's a part of you that's beginning to zoom further and further into those parts that keep rebounding and what they maybe asking from us now. Those parts that are still making the shift forward, a little bit scary. And I'm glad that there's so much honesty in whatever it is that you share. I would like to reassert exactly what it is that you said earlier in session- . Yes, you do mentally understand all of this — logically and rationally, it makes absolute sense. But in the context of saying no or putting yourself first, I think it's still something that requires effort from your side. I know that those must be difficult moments. They're empowering moments… but also very difficult moments. There's always that fear: what happens when we change? What happens to our relationships? How do other people perceive us? Would we be alone again? I think your suggestion of exploring companionship in the next session may also help find our footing on this.
CS27: hmm. You know, With N (friend), you’re also right in the sense that she’s always come to me for emotional chats. For all the years we hadn’t been in touch, now the way I’m showing up for her, it’s like she’s realizing that she took a lot of friendships for granted. I mean you can love somebody and all of those things, but you also have to realize the other person is a different person. And I feel sometimes, I could be wrong, but she’s also realized she wasn’t there for me in the way… I’m not talking about the dad stuff, but just in general. I have to realise that she wasn’t at my ability to be there for me. I think I was the only one who had the ability to be there for me. But now maybe in my own way I’m also opening up a little bit more, though it’s still mostly me listening to her. But in my own way, I’m sharing a little bit. And she always says, “You’re an inspiration to me on my tough days.” I think it's also for me to see different people, they’ve always been looking up to me. They always copy me.. And I’ve been vocalizing a bit more about how I feel I’ve been judged for doing things a different way previously… until suddenly people are like, “Wait, what she did was right.” And I think I’m learning to make peace with the fact that I guess whoever does something for the first time differently from others, they’re always going to face the most resistance.
TS23: There is so much I'm hearing from what you said!
CS28: Yeah and it’s not even a poor-me story. It’s just… it takes so much courage. You’re doing something not just for yourself but also in front of people who are either mocking it or silent or acting like it doesn’t matter. But then years later, they’re the ones copying it. And I guess the younger me just wanted one of them to say, “Hey, I see what you did there. And it helped me.” But they won’t. And I don’t want to be that person anymore who needs that. Because I’m learning to see it myself now. I don’t need their delayed applause. I just need to keep reminding myself of that. Because I keep slipping back into, “But what if they had said something back then?” And it makes me sad sometimes. But not stuck.
TS24: It makes sense it would still hurt and yet you see growth in yourself. 
CS29: Exactly. It’s like I can feel both. The grief of never being seen, and the strength of seeing myself anyway now. And I think I’m also realising that a lot of this is also not just about proving to others, it’s been about proving to myself. That I could survive it. That I could come out of something without turning cold or bitter. That I could still want connection, even when I was denied it. And I don’t think I say that enough. I’m proud of that.
TS25: That’s a beautiful thing to be proud of. Not just what you went through, but how you have been able to carry yourself through it.
CS30: Yeah. And I know I don’t owe anyone softness. But I still want to be soft. Like, strong but soft. Because that’s what feels truest to me. Even if the world hasn’t always known what to do with that.
TS26: That softness you are referring to,  it feels like a very conscious choice for you now as against before.
CS31: It is. It really is. It’s not naïve anymore. It’s not me being helpless or waiting around for people to change. It’s me choosing to stay open, because I like myself that way. And maybe that’s the biggest change. I used to feel like my softness made it easy to leave me. But now it feels like it’s what helps me stay with myself. 
TS27: That line, "it helps me stay with myself",  that feels like the anchor for this change.
CS32: Yeah. It’s like I don’t have to lose myself to be loved. That’s been the biggest learning. If I go, then who’s even being loved?
TS28: And maybe now, for the first time, you’re loving her too ,  the one who stayed.
CS33: I think so. I think I’m learning to. And that means forgiving her too. For all the times she didn’t know better. For when she settled. For when she stayed too long. For when she thought it was her fault. I want to be on her side now. Not against her. Not embarrassed of her. I think she tried. And that’s enough.
